        p
          | Purely student-run events for research students from all over the world to
          | share and discuss their research in computer science. The workshop
          | is unique in that submitting authors get the experience of reviewing
          | other students’ papers, providing them with a foretaste of being in
          | the program committee of a conference. It is a great opportunity to learn about
          | everything that is involved in the organization of a
          | conference.

          | Explaining your research in a simple and understandable way is a
          | professional necessity and the seminars series are unique venue for
          | students to practice these skills. 
          | The only constraint on the topic of
          | a talk is that it is of interest to other research students. This means
          | that a talk does not have to be about the speaker’s research project,
          | but could be work done during free time or other academic activities.

          | activities that are useful and interesting. If you have an idea -
          | for a competition, a tutorial, a side tour, or something else -
          | raise your voice. The Chapter also has a small budget and might be able
          | to sponsor the event. You can find more information and
