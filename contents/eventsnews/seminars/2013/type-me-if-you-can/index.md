I will take you on an evolution journey of computing most precious
concepts--data types and will present you a vision for the future--session
types. Types has served us well in the computation era. In the
talk, we would examine what is their role in the current era of
communication, concurrency and distribution. What does it mean for two
different programs, executed in different environments, to be type safe.
We will look at how session types can change the landscape of
programming practices and tools and how they can be used to prevent
deadlocks and to reduce the cost of producing software, while increasing
its reliability. Fasten your research belts, pack your bags of questions
and get ready to look into the future of distributed programming.
