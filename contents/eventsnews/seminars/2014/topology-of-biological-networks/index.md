There is a huge amount of available biological data  for different organisms,
describing interactions between biological macromolecules. Network
representations of such interaction data enable graph theoretic approaches to
identify topological properties of these networks which are different from what
is expected at random. This is how we can, for example, reveal the connection
between a specific topological property of a node in a biological network and a
specific biological function or a process. In this presentation I will talk
about an application of graph theory to human biological networks in research
of cardiovascular diseases.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are common in people with diabetes. However,
several recent clinical studies suggested a protective role of diabetes in the
development of one of the common CVDs - aneurysm. I will present our published
work where we use topology of biological networks to explore this interesting
relationship between diabetes and aneurysm. We also explain why there is no
similar influence of diabetes on atherosclerosis, given that aneurysm and
atherosclerosis are CVDs with similar risk factors.  Motivated by the
significance  of genetic interactions in understanding disease–disease
associations, we integrate genetic interaction data and protein-protein
interaction network to create a subnetwork of pathways related to the three
diseases. We then use a ‘‘brokerage’’ measure - a topological measure that
describes importance of a node in the network for the interconnectedness of its
neighbourhood. We use this measure to find set of ‘‘broker‘‘ proteins  that are
able to disrupt the pathways that they are part of.  We suspect that a mutation
of a gene in a pathway involved in diabetes is related to a functional change
of a protein in an aneurysm-related pathway. Hence, among broker proteins, we
identify 16 that are involved in an aneurysm or an atherosclerosis pathway and
are encoded by genes participating in genetic interactions with a gene in a
diabetes pathway.  Interestingly, this set is enriched in kinases which can act
like protein switches turning them on or off, explaining how functional changes
of such proteins could result in the disruption of pathways. We also find that
several of the kinases among broker genes, that are both on aneurysm and
atherosclerosis pathways, are pleiotropic. It is known that mutations of
pleiotropic genes could have effects only on one of the traits, which explains
why pleiotropic kinases that are involved in both aneurysm and atherosclerosis
pathways could disrupt aneurysm pathways explaining the reduced risk of
aneurysm in diabetes patients, but not affect the atherosclerosis pathways.
