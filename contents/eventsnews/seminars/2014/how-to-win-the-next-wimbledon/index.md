I will be talking about using spatio-temporal information for the analysis of
tennis matches. State-of-the-art tennis modelling techniques use player
statistics such as the percentage of points won in the first serve or double
faults. Advances in computer vision techniques and technology have made it
possible to obtain spatio-temporal data from tennis matches. It is now possible
to get the 3D position of both players and the ball, the shot speed and angle
and many more characteristics. In my work, I use this data in order to build
better models. For instance, one of the key differences with the
state-of-the-art tennis predicting models is that we can now look at
intra-point dynamics.

In this talk I will first describe the state-of-the-art approach to modelling
tennis matches. Then I will give an overview of some computer vision and
machine learning techniques that can be used to extract spatio-temporal data
from tennis videos. Finally I will talk about how these can be used to build
better tennis models.
