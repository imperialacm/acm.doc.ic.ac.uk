**Good practice:** Have as many small meetings with people you are sharing tasks with as possible.
For example, go for a coffee or for lunch to update each other about your progress and to make decisions.

There are also monthly meetings for the whole ACM Student Chapter organizing committee to update everyone about the current activities of the Chapter.

Meeting dates are used organised using [Doodle](https://doodle.com/)
