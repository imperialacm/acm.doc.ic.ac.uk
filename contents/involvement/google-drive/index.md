We will add your Gmail (or Imperial) email to our shared Google Drive folder.
We use Google Drive to store Student Chapter (and ICCSW) related documents and
templates. This has the advantage of being able to work on documents together
as well as to reuse documents in the future. Thus, if you create any documents
or templates, please drop them in Google Drive for future use by other people.

The URLs for the folders are

* [ACM](https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B3oy7SJp-r8zbngzZzJjWlRUZXc)
* [ICCSW](https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B3oy7SJp-r8zOGNkZTU3MTUtY2U3Zi00OGZhLWFiNGMtZWViYzMyM2VjOTRi)
