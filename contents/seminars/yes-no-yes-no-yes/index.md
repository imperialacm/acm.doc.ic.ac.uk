My talk will be an introduction to the research field of "Argumentation
Theory".
I will explain how Argumentation fits into the broader area of
Artificial Intelligence, and try to answer the questions "What is
Argumentation Theory?" and "Why bother?".
The obvious application of Argumentation Theory is in Multi-Agent
Systems, that is when two artificial or human agents argue with each
other. However, Argumentation Theory can also be applied in a wide range
of other decision-making scenarios, such as deciding on the medical
treatment of a given patient or evaluating whether or not a defendant is
guilty in court.
