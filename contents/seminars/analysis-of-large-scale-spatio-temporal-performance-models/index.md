Performance analysis is a discipline that aims to understand and improve
process behaviour. In particular the research area provides tools and
techniques to answer Quality of Service (QoS) related questions such as
"How many servers are required to provide a service latency of &lt;10ms
in 95% of all requests". Such problems are usually addressed through
model analysis. The focus of my PhD is to research evaluation methods
for the analysis of large spatio-temporal performance models, i.e.
models that take into account time as well as the spatial topology of
interacting processes. In particular I am trying to come up with
modelling and model analysis techniques for Wireless Sensor Network
(WSN) protocols. As WSN nodes are energy and processing power constraint
embedded devices, which communicate over an unreliable, low-bandwidth
wireless channel, QoS constraints are hard to balance and vary immensely
between different applications. Ideally my research in this area will
lead to novel modelling and evaluation methods that assist WSN system
designers in creating a protocol stack that achieves the required QoS
demands for the application in question.
