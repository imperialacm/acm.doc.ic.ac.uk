Multi-agent systems (MAS) are distributed systems in which components,or agents, interact with one another trying to reach private or common goals. One of the recent topics of interest in this area is the issue of verification and validation of MAS against temporal, epistemic, deontic, or strategic logics.

In this talk, I will present CTLPK, a parametric temporal-epistemic logic that extends the branching time temporal-epistemic logic CTLK with free variables representing groups of agents. The talk will focus on algorithms for automatically synthesising the groups of agents that satisfy a given parametric formula. The efficacy of this technique will be demonstrated with the use of an implementation of the technique on top of the open-source model checker MCMAS and by reporting some experimental results.

This is a joint work with Michal Knapik and Wojciech Penczek of the Institute of Computer Science of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Alessio Lomuscio of Imperial College London. The paper is nominated for a best paper award at AAMAS 2012, Valencia, Spain
