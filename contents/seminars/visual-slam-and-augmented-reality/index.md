In robotics, simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) is a technique which builds up a map within an unknown environment and at the same time keeps tracking the robot's location. A SLAM system which uses only visual information is called visual SLAM. The-state-of-the-art visual SLAM framework takes the advantage of sophisticated image processing algorithms and novel hardware architecture to achieve robust performance and fulfill real-time applications. This talk aims to give a brief introduction of visual SLAM to the audiences. Most of the content will cover the basic ideas, the related research topics and the works researchers in Imperial College London have done. Furthermore, since augmented reality is yet another more interesting field where visual SLAM can apply to, I will further show some notable demo videos to demonstrate the practical usage of visual SLAM and the impact this technology will bring to our daily life soon.
