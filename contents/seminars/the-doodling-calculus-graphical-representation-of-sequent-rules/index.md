This talk will be about ongoing research on how to represent those
confusing rules of sequent systems for different logics in a graphical
and (hopefully) more intuitive way by Doodles. Apart from a bunch of
pretty pictures this gives a tool for designing cut-free sequent calculi
for a number of modal logics. Such systems are interesting, since they
can do without a recourse to Lemmata in their proofs, and thus open the
way for backwards proof search and automated reasoning. Did I mention
there will be loads of pretty pictures?
