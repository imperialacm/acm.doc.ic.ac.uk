I will present an introduction and brief discussion into the
applications and variations of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), combining
unsupervised learning techniques with performance analysis measures.
Their parsimonious nature and efficient training on discrete and
continuous data traces have made them popular as storage workloads,
Markov Arrival Processes (MAPs), social network behaviour classifiers
and financial predictive models (to name but a few). We explain relevant
findings of the AESOP group (aesop.doc.ic.ac.uk/) over the last few
years and mention possible future research.
