Much research has been devoted to the use of argumentation to support inter-agent dialogues. Here, we contribute to this line of research by investigating the strategic behaviour of agents in argumentation-based dialogues, using Assumption-Based- Argumentation (ABA) as the underlying framework. We will focus on information-seeking and inquiry dialogues, giving formalisations thereof and showing how they can be supported by specific classes of strategy-move functions for agents to select suitable utterances. We will also discuss strategies that are used in persuasion dialogues and link them to some results in mechanism design.
