Our knowledge on the brain is relatively limited. Understanding how neurons communicate and cracking the neural code would help the treatment of disorders, such as epilepsy and memory loss, but is also indispensable for prosthetic technologies to interpret a subject's intentions, such as moving a prosthetic limb. Extracellular recordings from implanted electrodes are well positioned to tackle the challenge. The only problem, is that they obviously need to be powered on. Having to charge an implanted device is not very practical so a lot is being done in trying to reduce the energy requirements of these recordings. In this talk we will look at one part of the problem, which is to make sure only the minimum amount of data necessary for the decoding is recorded. Nyquist said in the 1920s that in order to sample a signal with no information loss, you need to sample at a rate at least twice the signal's bandwidth. We will see how we can beat Nyquist at his own game for a lightweight acquisition of neural information.
