People use different methods to make decisions. “Trial and error”, for
instance, is widely used by people to learn the best decisions from
experiences. Also, arguing with other people, or even self-arguing,
could help people to identify advantages and disadvantages of each
choice. In this talk, I will introduce how these two techniques can be
used jointly to help computers (autonomous agents) to make decisions.

First I will motivate my research, followed by a high-level description
of our integration technique. Also, I will compare the performances of
my technique and standard Reinforcement Learning on RoboCup Soccer
games, under both single-agent and multi-agent settings. Potential
application domains and future work will also be briefly discussed.
Videos and concrete examples will be running throughout this talk to
instantiate my ideas and techniques.
