Imagine that you had been working on a document using your favourite
application, but one day something happened to the file and you cannot
open it anymore: every time you try to open the document, the
application crashes or does not load the file. You would like to have
your document back because it has some important data in it and you
would not like to sacrifice much of the document contents in order to
make it work again.

In this seminar I will talk about: the reasons why documents can cause
incorrect operation of software, symbolic execution techniques that can
be used to tackle this problem and my research project which is about a
document recovery approach that is independent of the input format.
