Classification of objects is a fundamental and innate ability of our
brain, which allows us to use a limited set of words to describe an
almost infinite space of different objects, for instance, learning to
classify food into nutritious or poisonous has been a key to the
survival of organisms.  The algorithmic and neuronal implementations of
human classification are, however, not well understood.  Why is it that
a single example from a new class is sufficient to spawn a new category?
Why and when do we generate new categories and how do we update them
dynamically? How do our minds get so much from so little? We build rich
models through which we make strong generalizations, and construct
powerful abstractions, while the input data are noisy and often
ambiguous. The impressive ease with which humans deal with these
problems has been a major focus of the research community with many
potential applications. In this talk, I will introduce recent approaches
to reverse-engineering human category learning and discuss why gaining
an understanding of the mechanisms that humans use to categorise data is
essential for learning how the brain functions and how this knowledge
can be used to create even more intelligent machines.
