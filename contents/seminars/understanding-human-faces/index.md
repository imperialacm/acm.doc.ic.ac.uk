Powered by ever more sophisticated sensors, the machines of the future
will interact with humans far more naturally than is possible today.
Most of us find face-to-face interaction the most comfortable and for
good reason - the brain does an outstanding job of interpreting the
identity and emotional state of another human - all from just looking at
their face.

With this in mind we seek to develop algorithmic approaches to
understanding the human face. I'll explain how powerful generative
models of the face can be constructed, and what we can learn from them.
I'll then demonstrate the usefulness of such models in identity and
emotion recognition, and highlight how our collaboration with Great
Ormond Street Hospital is helping advance craniofacial surgery
techniques. Finally, I'll talk about where we can take statistical
facial modelling in the future, and discuss some of the challenges that
we most overcome in order to advance.
