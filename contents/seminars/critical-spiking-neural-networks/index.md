Artificial intelligence is used as an umbrella term describing our
attempts at reproducing  two key human characteristics, intelligence and
thought.  We know that these abilities come from the brain, so why not
start by reproducing the human brain ?  A spiking neural network is an
attempt at modelling how neural cells in nature behave dynamically. By
reproducing the electrical signals of a single neuron and connecting
neurons together we observe a complex interaction of spiking activity
possibly underlying the intelligent behavior we see in nature.  In my
talk I will briefly describe this technique and give several examples on
its application in neuroscience and artificial intelligence.  I will
conclude by defining what a critical network is and how chaotic behavior
plays an important role in optimizing information processing in neural
networks.  This talk will be for those of you who are curious on how to
make an artificial "brain" and how the chaos in your mind not only makes
your forget where your house keys are but also optimizes your thought
processes.
