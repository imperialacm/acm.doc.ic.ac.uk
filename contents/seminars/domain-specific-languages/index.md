A rule of thumb in computing says that generality and efficiency are
conflicting goals when designing a system. In a similar way, a
high-level system is generally regarded as less efficient than a
low-level system. In this talk I will show that this is not necessarily
the case and how domain-specific languages can be used as a building
block in efficient yet high-level computational frameworks. Not only do
they provide the key to computational efficiency, but also to programmer
productivity and more maintainable codes.
