Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been adopted in many applications as a high performance information collection platform; however, they are prone to unexpected faults caused by resource constrains and its instability in wireless communications. Therefore, to isolate faulty sensor readings from normal ones, a reliable fault detection system is necessary. Unfortunately, current works on fault detection is limiting as they make unrealistic or narrow assumptions. In order to construct an effective system, we propose a spatial temporal correlation-based fault detection system that only assumes the existence of correlations between sensor readings. While the design of a distributed fault detection system has not yet been completed, a centralized version has already been implemented and the experiment result will follow.
