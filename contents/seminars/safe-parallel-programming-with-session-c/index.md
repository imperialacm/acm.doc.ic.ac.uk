I will talk about my current research work on a message-passing parallel
programming framework called Session C. This framework focuses on high
performance applications and is based upon the theoretical basis of
session types, thus can guarantee 'safety' in communication and the
absence of deadlocks in programs designed and implemented in this
framework.
