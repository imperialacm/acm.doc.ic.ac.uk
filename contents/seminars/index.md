### Giving a talk at seminar?

Explaining your research in a simple and understandable way is a
professional necessity and the seminars series are unique venue for
students to practice these skills. Guidelines for the seminar talks are
available and everybody is encouraged to participate. 
Feel free to ask the audience for advice at the end on whether the
slides were clear or whether or not the introduction was too long or any
other concern of yours. We are here to help you.
