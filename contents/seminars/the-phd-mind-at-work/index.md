In this talk I will discuss the impact that a PhD has on my life. More
specifically, what drove me into a PhD, how it helped me to get a job
and what difference it is making in my current role. This will include
R&D challenges I face on a day-to-day basis and how they are tackled
using an academic way of thinking. For that, this talk will focus on
methodology rather than technical knowledge and highlight why the PhD
experience may be more important than you might think.
