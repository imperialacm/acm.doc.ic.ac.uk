LaTeX is one of the most widespread markup languages for writing
scientific research papers. However, despite using it frequently, most
users only resort to a fraction of tools and packages that LaTeX has to
offer. I I personally found that in particular with respect to graph and
table plotting, many users appear to prefer generating figures outside
LaTeX, even though LaTeX offers excellent tools for doing so. Similarly
many plots that I see in research papers were not created natively in
LaTeX.

In this tutorial I am going to give an introduction to:
* PGF (Portable graphics format)
* PGFPlotsTable
* TikZ (Tikz ist kein Zeichenprogramm - TikZ is not a drawing tool)

Aside from discussing benefits and drawbacks of using these tools as
opposed to gnuplot or SVG-drawing programs, I will mostly focus on how
the above tools can be integrated into an efficient paper writing
workflow.

_NOTE: Basic LaTeX knowledge is expected (if you ever created a
TeX document from scratch thatâ€™ll be enough to follow the talk)._
