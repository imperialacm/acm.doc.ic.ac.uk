In the first talk of the newly re-started student seminar series, I am
going to introduce our vision for these student-led talks as an
opportunity for (research) students in any field of Computer Science
to learn about each other's research, to share and discuss new ideas.
I am also going to talk about Imperial College London ACM Student
Chapter, the first ACM student chapter in the United Kingdom whose aim
is to create an active Computing research student community within our
Department. I will explain the importance of these student activities,
both from research as well as career perspective using my own
experience and tell you how to take a part and become actively
involved.
