A fundamental challenge in the development of image-guided surgical systems is alignment of the preoperative model to the endoscopic operative image. This is achieved by finding corresponding structures in the preoperative scans and on the live surgical view. In robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), the most readily visible structure is the bone of the pelvic rim. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice for prostate cancer detection and staging, but extraction of bone from MRI is difficult and very time consuming to achieve manually. We present a robust and fully automated multi-atlas pipeline for bony pelvis segmentation from MRI, using a MRI appearance embedding statistical deformation model (AE-SDM). Several metrics are used to quantify the overlap between the automated and manual segmentations. Compared to the manual gold standard segmentations, our robust segmentation method produced outperforms state-of-art algorithms for MRI bony pelvis segmentation. In this talk, I will introduce MRI appearance embedding statistical deformation model (AE-SDM), and how to use this model to improve multi-atlas segmentation for our specific task. Furthermore, I will show the demo that the resulting bony pelvis surface can be tracked in the endoscopic view in near real time.
