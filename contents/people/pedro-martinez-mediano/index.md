In the early days, and forced by an evil mathematician father, Pedro started a
Physics degree at University of Valencia, Spain, truncating what could have
otherwise been a promising career as a jazz melodica player. Not satisfied with
the punishment of an undergrad in Physics, he moved to the different, but
marginally more useful field of Artificial Intelligence and Computational
Neuroscience. He somehow sneaked into a PhD program at Imperial College,
London, where he found that Artificial Intelligence might be artificial, but is
far from being intelligent. He is now doing his little bit to change the last
part. He thinks that writing in third person looks cool.
