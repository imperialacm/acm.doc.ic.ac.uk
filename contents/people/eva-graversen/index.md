I am a PhD student working on reversible event structures under the supervision of Dr. Iain Phillips and Prof. Nobuko Yoshida.
I received my bachelor and masters degree in computing from Aalborg University and joined Imperial in 2016. 
My main interests include semantics, logics, reversibility, and types.
