The kinds of activities a student chapter can undertake are diverse
and it is up to all of us, the chapter members, to decide and organise
activities that are useful and interesting. If you have an idea -
for a competition, a tutorial, a side tour, or something else -
raise your vice. The Chapter also has a small budget and might be able
to sponsor the event. You can find more information and
inspiration for chapter activities here.
