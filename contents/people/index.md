The kinds of activities a student chapter can undertake are diverse and it is up to all of us, the chapter members, to decide and organise activities that are useful and interesting.
If you have an idea for a competition, a tutorial, a side tour, or something else raise your vice.
The Chapter also has a small budget and might be able to sponsor the event.
You can find more information and inspiration for chapter activities here.
