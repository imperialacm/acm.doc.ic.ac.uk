## Get in touch

The kinds of activities a student chapter can undertake are diverse
and it is up to all of us, the chapter members, to decide and organise
activities that are useful and interesting. If you have an idea -
for a competition, a tutorial, a side tour, or something else -
raise your vice. The Chapter also has a small budget and might be able
to sponsor the event. You can find more information and
inspiration for chapter activities here.  

Whenever you have something to say, just talk to us! There is always an ACM Chapter member at every event. You can also send us an [email](mailto:acm-officers@imperial.ac.uk).
