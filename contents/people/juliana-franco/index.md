I am third year PhD student at Imperial College London where I work on memory management techniques for actor based languages.  I received my BSc (in 2011) and MSc (in 2013) degrees in Computing from University of Lisbon. I joined Imperial College in 2014 where I am supervised by Prof. Sophia Drossopoulou and Prof. Nobuko Yoshida.  My research interests include type systems, concurrency, parallelism and memory management -- if it is about programming languages, I'm probably interested!
