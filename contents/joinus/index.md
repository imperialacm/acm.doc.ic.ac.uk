The first step for you to get involved is to join the chapter. You
can be involved as a listener, as an organiser, as a speaker; it is
your choice how and how much you want to contribute. Memberships are
open to all Imperial postgraduate students and you don’t have to be
an ACM member to join the Imperial College London ACM Student Chapter.
