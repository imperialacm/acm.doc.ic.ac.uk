# Subscribe Us
The first step for you to get involved is to subscribe the chapter.
You can be involved as a listener, as an organiser, as a speaker; it is your choice how and how much you want to contribute.
Memberships are open to all Imperial postgraduate students and you don’t have to be an ACM member to join the Imperial College London ACM Student Chapter.

### Why subscribe us?

* To express your acknowledgement for the activities run by the Student Chapter. 
There are no commitments involved in becoming a member, it’s for free and super simple - just sign up with your email-address on our homepage as an expression that you value the work done by the Chapter.

* This is essential for the Student Chapter to continue running activities in the future - even if you don’t attend events, expressing your support by becoming a member of the Student Chapter helps us in contacting companies, getting funding, and so on.

* It's free!
