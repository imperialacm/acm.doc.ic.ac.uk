Software systems are constantly evolving, with new versions being
released on a continuous basis. Unfortunately, software updates present
a difficult challenge; the hassle involved in updating software--the
fact you have to stop the application to upgrade it--combined with the
fear that an update will introduce new bugs, means that many users
simply do not do it, leaving their computers exposed to crash-prone,
insecure code. In this talk, I will introduce a radically new approach
that makes updating software less error-prone and disruptive, by making
use of idle cores in multicore machines.
