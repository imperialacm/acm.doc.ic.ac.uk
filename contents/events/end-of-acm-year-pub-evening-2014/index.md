We're having a fun get together to celebrate the hard work done by the
previous commitee and just have a bit of fun.  Come join and enjoy the
evening with free food! If you're a member of the ACM student chapter
you also get free drinks!  If you're not already a member [become a
member now](/membership/) (it's free) or come along
to experience why you should join.
