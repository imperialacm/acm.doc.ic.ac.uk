We live in a world surrounded by technology. But only a tiny fraction of
students learn how computers work, or how to create software technology.
Computer Science provides a foundation for virtually any career and all
students can benefit from learning the basics. 

This year, for [Computer Science Education Week](http://csedweek.org/),
a massive campaign called the Hour of Code is introducing 10 million
students to try one hour of introductory computer science.

We are bringing this campaing to Imperial College London, so all
students across all fields can participate.
[Register](http://imperialcsed.eventbrite.co.uk/) today and join us on
Wednesday 11th December, between 1pm and 2pm in Royal School of Mines
G07. We will do our best to demistify "code" and show you that anyone can
learn the basics to be a maker, a creator, an innovator.

We are also looking for students who already know how to code and would
like to help participants during the event. Please get in touch with us
if you belong to this category.
