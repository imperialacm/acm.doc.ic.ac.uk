Parallel programming is notoriously difficult. Years of research had led
to a plethora of models and languages for parallel programming, yet the
majority of the scientific computing community is stuck with
Message-Passing Interface, a standard designed 20 years ago. MPI is
known for its robustness but not for its user-friendliness, and
communication errors are often hidden in plain sight. Session Types is a
formal system that uses types to abstract interaction patterns and
making sure message-passing communication do not go wrong, combining
session types and MPI seems a sensible way to make parallel programming
but is it really that simple?  In this talk, I will introduce session
types in the context of parallel programming and what it brings to
making parallel programming easier and safer.
