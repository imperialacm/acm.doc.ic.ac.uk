Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are common in people with diabetes. However,
several recent clinical studies suggested a protective role of diabetes in the
development of one of the common CVDs - aneurysm. I will present our published
work where we use topology of biological networks to explore this
interesting relationship between diabetes and aneurysm. We also explain why
there is no similar influence of diabetes on atherosclerosis, given that
aneurysm and atherosclerosis are CVDs with similar risk factors.  Motivated by
the significance  of genetic interactions in understanding diseaseâ€“disease
associations, we integrate genetic interaction data and protein-protein
interaction network to create a subnetwork of pathways related to the three
diseases.

We then use a "brokerage" measure - a topological measure that
describes importance of a node in the network for the interconnectedness of its
neighbourhood. We use this measure to find "broker" proteins  that are able
to disrupt the pathways that they are part of. We find a set of  broker
proteins and we discover that it is enriched in biological functions that
facilitate mechanisms  behind protective role of diabetes on aneurysm.  We
further narrow down our set to 16 proteins that are involved in an aneurysm or
an atherosclerosis pathway and are encoded by genes participating in genetic
interactions with a gene in a diabetes pathway.  This set is enriched in
kinases which can act like protein switches turning them on or off, explaining
how functional changes of such proteins could result in the disruption of
pathways. We also find that several broker genes that are both on aneurysm and
atherosclerosis pathways are pleiotropic kinases. Mutations of pleiotropic
genes could have effects only on one of the traits, which explains why
pleiotropic kinases that are involved in both aneurysm and atherosclerosis
pathways could disrupt aneurysm pathways explaining the reduced risk of
aneurysm in diabetes patients, but not affect the atherosclerosis pathways.
