Decisal is a company that sprung-out of Imperial College London when PhD
students invented several novel algorithms for [airline planning and scheduling
optimization](http://www.decisal.com).  These algorithms are now helping
airlines improve their operations and as a result save millions every year.
Before Decisal's algorithms, airlines in order to reduce complexity were forced
to separate fleet and network planning, as well as fleet, aircraft, and crew
scheduling. However, all these processes are interdependent and such separation
was unable to capture their mutual interaction and contribution to
profitability. Decisal's novel algorithms now provide airlines with Unified
Optimization where all planning and scheduling steps are tackled
simultaneously, accounting for these interactions and resulting in an overall
profit maximization.
