WriteLaTeX is an online collaborative editor for writing scientific documents,
like papers and theses. It started as idea and a hodgepodge of scripts I wrote
as a PhD student. Now we're a high growth, venture-backed startup and social
enterprise, with hundreds of thousands of users around the world. I'll talk
first about writeLaTeX and how you can use it in your work, then about our
startup story, and finally about some of the technical challenges we face in
bringing a 30-year old technology (TeX) online and in scaling up (e.g. I'll
mention Docker, Ruby on Rails, data protection, cloud services, and bugs, lots
of bugs).
