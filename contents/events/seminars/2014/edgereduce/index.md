This talk describes an approach for reducing network traffic over radio
access networks (RANs), e.g. 3G and 4G networks, associated with mobile
client applications such as social networking, photo sharing and
e-commerce clients. Such applications rely on frequent interactions with
Internet backend services, which often entail unnecessary data transfers
due to the coarse granularity of backend API calls and the aggressive
prefetching strategies used.  Our approach automatically partitions
mobile client applications to offload the application logic responsible
for processing API response data to remote nodes at edge locations of a
mobile network.  This allows for unused data to be discarded before
traversing the RAN. This benefits both mobile users—by reducing
increased data usage charges—and network operators—by reducing network
contention in limited RANs.
