Probabilistic reasoning allows us to act rationally under uncertainty.
Logical inference allows us to act rationally given a set of premises
and rules. If you want to know how to act rationally under uncertain
premises, you need to define a probabilistic logic. If you don't know
how to do that, come to my talk and find out. I will review
probabilistic logic in a brief and biased manner, and exemplify my
perspective on the matter. I will also discuss key challenges of the
field and propose some initial solutions in my area of interest.
