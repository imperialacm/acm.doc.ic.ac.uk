What do you do with a BA in War Studies? In my case: an MSc and a PhD at
DoC. These degrees in turn led to jobs at a number of academic and
non-academic institutions, including at one point returning to the
Department as a post-doc in the research group with which I did my PhD.
In this talk I will discuss my experience of working in a variety of
environments and reflect on how my time(s) at DoC prepared me for what
was to come.
