[Imperial College Computing Student Workshop (ICCSW)](/workshops/) is
the annual student research workshop in our department and the flagship
event of the Imperial College London ACM Student Chapter. This workshop
differs from most research workshops out there in that, it targets all
areas in Computer Science, and all the organisation from planning to
on-the-day arrangements are done by PhD students in our department. In
the last 3 years, we have had attendees from all over Europe---a truly
remarkable achievement for a student-run event. Visit [the official
workshop website](http://iccsw.doc.ic.ac.uk/) to see what we we have
done in the past (we even have our own proceedings published!)

The aim of the workshop is to share research results and facilitate
networking between junior researchers. It is also a great opportunity
for to-be academics to experience running a research workshop first
hand. This is a very handy experience, especially if you are interested
in a career in academia. The workshop will be held in the last Thursday
and Friday of September 2014, just before term starts, but preparation
starts now.

If you have not attended conferences/workshops before, don't worry! You
will learn everything you need to know on the job. Participating in the
organisation team will involve:

* Willingness to learn and contribute; we will share our experiences of
  running the workshop in the past, but you are invited to suggest
  something we haven't thought about, it's your workshop, you can do what
  you want.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>
* Taking on responsibilities; all organisers are volunteers and the
  success of the workshop depends largely on the how much responsibilities
  your are willing to take.
* Spare time; this will not be part of your main research, so be prepared
  to spend some spare time on it, we know how busy we all are, so we will
  work as a team to split the workload.
* Passion.
