We will visit the World War II code-breaking centre including a tour of
Bletchley Park museum to see original restored enigma machines and the
original 'Bombe' device used to crack the Enigma code. The visit will
also include a guided tour of the National Museum of Computing to see
many of the world's first electronic computers, including a fully
operational 'Colossus'. Both museums are running guided tours especially
for us!

The total trip will cost less than Â£30 including the train ticket but
not including lunch. The ACM Student Chapter will subsidise this trip,
so final price will depend on the exact group size.
