Have you ever considered doing an internship during your PhD? Are you aware of
the internship opportunities for PhD students? Come find out at the annual PhD
Internship Event organized by the ACM Student Chapter.

Google, IBM Research, JP Morgan, Microsoft Research and Thomson Reuters will
give short presentations on PhD internship opportunities. This session will be
shortly followed by a networking event during which you can ask specific
questions related to your interests, and also interact with PhD students in our
department who have already done internships:

Jack (IBM),
Lukas (IBM),
Raul (LinkedIn),
Lucas (Thomson Reuters) and
