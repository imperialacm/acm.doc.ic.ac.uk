Cloud has become one of the most-popular buzzword of the recent years,
yet most people still do not understand what the cloud is and how it can
help them in their work. In this tutorial, I will try to uncover part of
the mystery and show you what the cloud really is. Contrary to some of
the popular beliefs, I will try to convince you that the cloud is not
something you have to be afraid of; rather opposite, combined with the
right tooling, it can really benefit your workflow. Furthermore, I will
show you how to use tools such as Vagrant or Packer to make an order in
your virtual machines and how to use them to harness the power of the
departmental cloud, so the next time, when you need to run a massive
computational job just a few days before your paper deadline, you will
know what to do.
