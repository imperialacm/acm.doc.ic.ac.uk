We had an amazing ice skating event at QUEENS skate near Queensway State.
Even though it is the first time for some of us to skate, but luckily we also have few peers who are very good at ice-skating.
We also have some fresh faces to join our social event for the first time.
Some went for a dinner after the ice skating.

If you miss this time, you can join our next time social event!
Come to the event, join us and have fun!
For those who have not subscribe us yet, do that now, as we will send the event announcement through email.

Thanks for [Macrosoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) who sponsors this event.
