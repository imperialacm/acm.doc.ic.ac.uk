Imperial College London ACM Student chapter together with the Corporate
Partnership Program is organizing a *PhD internship event* on Monday
25th November.

This is a great opportunity to find out more about the experience of
former PhD interns (your fellow PhD students), including how to get an
internship, the best time for an internship, etc.Furthermore, we will
have companies who are especially interested in having PhD students as
interns. So far, Thomson Reuters confirmed their interest, and we
are currently in contact with other companies like IBM, Google, etc.

We are looking for PhD students who has done an internship and would
like to share their experience. If you belong to this category, please
get in touch with us.
