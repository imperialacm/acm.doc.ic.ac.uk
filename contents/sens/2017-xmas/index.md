#### Our last social event for this year was the Christmas Dinner. 

Thanks to everybody who decided to spend the evening with us â˜º, as we all know the end of a term could be very busy.
We also had [Tom Ellis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/toelli/) on behalf of our sponsor [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) who gave us a short talk about the career as a research software engineer in [Microsoft Research Cambridge (MSR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/).
The research software engineers in [MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) help researchers and transfer research ideas into software prototypes and then into products.
Fortunately [MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) always welcomes Imperial College students for internship and jobs.
