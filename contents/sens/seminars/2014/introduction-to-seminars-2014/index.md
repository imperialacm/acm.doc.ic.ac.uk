This introductory seminar provides more information about the ACM (Association
for Computing Machinery) in general, as well as about the ACM Student Chapter
and its organizing members.

We are happy to announce that Prof. Alexander Wolf, who is both a professor in
the Computing Department at Imperial College working on distributed systems,
networking, and software engineering and the current president of the ACM, will
join this first Seminar to talk about the ACM as well as his work.

This first Seminar will also be the perfect opportunity to ask questions about
the ACM Student Chapter, to suggest events that you would like to see
happening, and to find out more about how to get involved.
