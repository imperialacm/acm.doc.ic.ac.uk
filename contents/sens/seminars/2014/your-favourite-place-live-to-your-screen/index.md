It's true we restless people often come up with exciting ideas. And it's true
we like to imagine them rolling out to be successful businesses. But what is it
like when you get an idea like that and try to make it part of the real world,
part of your life?

Our story is the story of four postgraduates trying to put together a tech
startup under several constraints. Our talk will guide you through our business
narrative, some technical challenges we had to confront, as well as the main
lessons we learned through this whole exciting process.
