In our everyday lives we engage in numerous dialogues as we socialise
with people around us. Most times we attempt to persuade others to
accept our point of view, which requires that we strategize against them
so as to increase our chances of winning. However, as we are unaware of
their knowledge we can only rely on our assumptions on what they might
know, which are usually based on our previous  dialogues with them, i.e.
on the arguments they used in those dialogues. So for every individual
we come against we can construct a model of their knowledge consisting
of all the arguments they ever used against us, and rely on it for
strategizing.

But wait a second! Is this all we can do? Could we possibly infer more
things about what one might know given what we assume they know? And if
yes, how can we do that? In this presentation we explore this
possibility through intuitive everyday examples, which appeal to
intuition and make conveying the ideas behind our research easy and fun.
Need more reasons to attend this talk? How about never losing an
argument again?
