#### After a year hiatus, ICCSW was back!
###### 26th - 27th Sept.


It was a great success on all fronts, with over 30 students attending a variety of interesting and novel talks, covering systems, networking, programming languages and machine learning.
This year, aloneside with the student talks, keynotes _Google’s Javascript Engine_ from Leszek Swirski and _How to Write a Great Paper_ from Simon Peyton Jones, and social event in Sky Garden, we had a new addition of a breakfast poster session, where students arose first thing in the morning to be quizzed on their posters, as inquisitive wanderers chowed down on croissants and coffee.

We hosted two exciting keynotes, _Google’s JavaScript Engine_ (Leszek Swirski) and _How to Write a Great Paper_ (Simon Peyton Jones), both of which saw many students and staff attend.
Leszek Swirski talked their recent work on optimisation of V8 JavaScript Engine.
By looking at the run-time state, they increase the performance of JavaScript codes.
Simon Peyton Jones talked several tips for writing a research paper.
All those tips are helpful for many junior and even senior researchers.

For our social event, we invited the students to explore the Sky Garden atop the Walkie Talkie and took them on a tour of the surrounding London sights, including the Tower of London and Tower Bridge, before settling down for dinner and dessert afterward.
