## Want to be a part of it?

We have already started preparations for the ICCSW'14 taking place in
September 2014, and we are looking for students within our
department to form a local organisation committee. The new members
will work side-by-side with experienced members who have organised
the workshop in previous years, so do not worry if you have never
organised a workshop/conference before; we will be there to help you!
All organisation and reviewing are done by students, and this is a
chance for you to experience running a research workshop. You will have
a unique chance to influence the format and way the workshop is run.
