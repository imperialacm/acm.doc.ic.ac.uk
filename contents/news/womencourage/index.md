ACM-W Europe, the Association for Computing Machinery's Committee on
Women in Computing in Europe are sponsoring a conference specifically
for encouraging women to stay in the field. This conference will be held
in Manchester, UK, with the motto womENcourage. We encourage all
students to submit a poster and to apply for travel grants so that they
have the funds to travel to the conference.
