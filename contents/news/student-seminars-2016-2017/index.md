</p>

Following the success of previous years we continue our biweekly student seminars
where PhD students from the department get the chance to present their project to the rest of us.
This is a great chance to learn about the research that is being carried out in the department, so 
join us every second Wednesday at 15:00 and we will provide great speakers as well as snacks!

If you know any potential speakers or want to present your own work let us know: jvicent1@ic.ac.uk.
We will announce each of the speakers closer to the date so keep an eye out for the posters around the department!
