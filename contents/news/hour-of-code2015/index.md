</p>

We are very glad to present the ACM Imperial Chapter Hour of Code 2015 
event! The Hour of Code is an international event organised by the mothership ACM to 
promote Computer Science public education. Join several millions of 
students coding simultaneously all over the planet! (Each one on a separate computer)


In the Hour of Code you will get the chance to try out some programming with the help
of expert, all-knowing computer science PhD students. We suggest you to try a slick, powerful 
language called Python,that is used by many top-notch companies like Youtube and Dropbox. 
The tutorials will be adequate to any level from code-phobic to  intermediate. 
The duration of the event is, against all odds, sixty minutes.

Also, the Hour of Code, or as we call it, the Moment of Joy, will be followed by copious
amounts of free pizza! This is so that you recover from the rewarding 
mental and physical effort that is writing a computer program. The rules
for the obtainment of free pizza are simple: No Python, no pizza. 
Python, pizza. Or, in Python:


if you.going(HourOfCode):
   you.fill(pizza)
else:
   you.regret()


Other less interesting, but nonetheless useful information:
