After having won the **2013/14 Student Chapter Excellence Award for Outstanding
School Services**, the Imperial College London ACM Student Chapter was invited
to send two representatives to the [2nd ACM Europe Chapter
Workshop](http://cecl.acm.org/athens/) held in September 2014 in Athens,
Greece. Bringing together Student Chapters, SIGs (Special Interest Groups), and
National Chapters, this workshop provided a platform for networking, discussing
best-practice with respect to chapter management, and learning more about ACM
and its valuable resources used to support chapters.

Financially supported by the [Corporate Partnership
Program](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/cpp/) of the Department of Computing at
Imperial College, the current chair (Claudia Schulz) and finance officer
(Silvia Vinyes Mora) of the Imperial College ACM Student Chapter were able to
attend the workshop in Athens, returning to Imperial College with a lot of new
**motivation** and **energy** to get more students involved in the Student Chapter.
This motivation and energy is now spreading to the other members of the Student
Chapter, leading to improved organisation, involvement, and recruitment.

In addition to representing the Imperial College ACM Student Chapter in front
of other chapters, thus enhancing its prominence in Europe, the two
representatives of the Student Chapter also got a chance to network with people
such as the former ACM presidents **Wendy Hall** and **Alain Chesnais**, the ACM Europe
Chair Fabrizio Gagliardi, and the ACM-W Europe Chair Reyyan Ayfer. As a result,
the Imperial College ACM Student Chapter has now established itself as a
well-known member of an **international network of excellent and influential
Computer Scientists.**

The workshop sessions were split into two parts. One part, comprising **talks**
by ACM-Europe officers including organisational topics like “Managing your ACM
Chapter” and “What is ACM-W” as well as technical talks on social computing and
concurrency; the other part, comprising smaller **working groups** for
discussing chapter-related issues such as what activities to run, how to find
new committee members, and  how to establish collaborations between chapters.
Both types of sessions provided the two representatives of the Student Chapter
with many **new ideas** for improving the Imperial College ACM Student Chapter.

In summary, the 2nd ACM Europe Chapter Workshop was a valuable experience for
the two representatives of the Imperial College ACM Student Chapter, providing
them with many new ideas and a lot of motivation, both of which they are now
spreading in the Student Chapter.
