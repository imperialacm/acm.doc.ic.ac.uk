  "bio": "Anida is a third year PhD student in Computational Network Biology Research Group under the supervision of Dr. Natasa Przulj at the Department of Computing, Imperial College London.  Anida uses computational methods and graph theory to analyse  topology of large bimolecular networks. She develops new topological measures, or uses existing ones in novel ways, with goal of discovering new biological knowledge, for example inferring proteins' roles in cardio-vascular diseases. She is also interested in applying new topological measures to other real world networks such as world trade networks, social networks etc."
