    "bio": "is a final year PhD student in the Software Performance Optimisation Group at Imperial College London. His primary research interests are domain-specific languages and compilers to translate mathematical models into low level code. His work is mostly concerned with delivering high-level tools in the hands of scientists, allowing them to work productively and run simulations efficiently on a range of modern multi- and many-core hardware platforms. He used to run the Graduate Students' Union (GSU) as vice president and the Linux Users' Group ICLUG. In his spare time he is a keen photographer and enjoys travelling and the outdoors. At night he looks after 125 undergraduates as a hall warden."
